## Overview

This application is built using React. A user can input a city and see latitude and longitude coordinates, and a geolocation of that city. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Create a new React app on your local machine ``` npx create-react-app my-app ```.
3. Create your own GitHub repo and clone this repo onto your local machine.
4. Create a LocationIQ account and get your personal API key.
5. Open the app within your code editor and create a .env file to store your API key.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Built using React, Bootstrap, and axios for API handling.

## Change Log
